{"question_id": "9d578ddccc27dd849244d632dd0f6bf27348ad81", "predicted_answer": "The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 82.2% on a test set of Japanese sentences without manually labeled data, outperforms a baseline method, and improves supervised learning results when labeled data are small.", "predicted_evidence": ["no evidence found"]}
{"question_id": "02e4bf719b1a504e385c35c6186742e720bcb281", "predicted_answer": "Discourse relations are used to propagate polarity by linking words or phrases that have the same affective polarity, and the proposed method uses a seed lexicon to assign affective polarity to words in a sentence and to propagate polarity from the words with known polarity to the words with unknown polarity.", "predicted_evidence": ["no evidence found"]}
{"question_id": "44c4bd6decc86f1091b5fc0728873d9324cdde4e", "predicted_answer": "The Japanese data used in the paper is a corpus of 1.5 million sentences, collected from news articles, blogs and social media posts and pre-processed by removing stop words and punctuation and normalizing the word forms.", "predicted_evidence": ["no evidence found"]}
