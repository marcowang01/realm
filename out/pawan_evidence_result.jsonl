The authors also used two other baselines, including Sentence-level BLEU, and SSE (Sentence-level Smoothed-BLEU with Extra weighting). The paper describes how these baselines were utilized to evaluate the performance of their proposed method for sentence-level fluency evaluation. Specifically, the paper compares the results obtained from the proposed method and the three baselines to show the effectiveness of their method. Therefore, ROUGE alone is not their only baseline."]}

They provided descriptions of each of the models used and their configurations. The experiments also included comparing the performance of their models to other existing language models such as GPT-2 and GRU. They evaluated the models using a fluency score and provided results of the evaluations, showing that their models outperformed existing ones."]}

{"question_id": "f0317e48dafe117829e88e54ed2edab24b86edb1", "predicted_answer": "Misaligned images in the multimodal neural machine translation model.", "predicted_evidence": ["The paper discusses the misbehavior of the model due to misaligned images commonly found in the datasets. The authors trained a multimodal neural machine translation model on the Multi30k dataset, which contains images that are aligned with their corresponding sentences. However, in real-world scenarios, images may not always align with their sentences. The results of the study showed that the model output can be negatively affected by misaligned images, resulting in poor translation quality. The authors suggest that future research should focus on incorporating methods to handle misaligned images in multimodal neural machine translation models."]}
